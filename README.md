# PhyloGWAS
Use PhyloGWAS to identify genes that are associated with floral color in Pedicularis.

## Basic information
PhyloGWAS is used to identify genetic variation associate with trait evolution. More specifically, PhyloGWAS tries to find nonsynonymous variants that are shared by species with same phenotypic trait but are not in a monophyletic group. 

PhyloGWAS is a variant of GWAS (Genome wide associate studies). Instead of sequencing more than 100 individuals of two populations with distinct phenotypic trait, PhyloGWAS divides species with distinct phenotypic trait into two groups and treats groups as "populations" in GWAS. I think "Phylo" in PhyloGWAS refers to one of its prerequisites that species belonging to the same group should not be in a monophyletic group.
